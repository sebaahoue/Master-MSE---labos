(The Choice of Decimal or Binary Representation)\t1959-12\tThe binary number system offers many advantages over a decimal representation for a high-performance, general-purpose computer.  The greater simplicity of a binary arithmetic unit and the greater compactness of binary numbers both contribute directly to arithmetic speed.  Less obvious and perhaps more important is the way binary addressing and instruction formats can increase the overall performance.  Binary addresses are also essential to certain powerful operations which are not practical with decimal instruction formats. On the other hand, decimal numbers are essential for communicating between man and the computer.  In applications requiring the processing of a large volume of inherently decimal input and output data, the time for decimal-binary conversion needed by a purely binary computer may be significant.  A slower decimal adder may take less time than a fast binary adder doing an addition and two conversions.  A careful review of the significance of decimal and binary addressing and both binary and decimal data arithmetic, supplemented by efficient conversion instructions."}

This facility is to be capable of preparing programs for any of a variety of machines having characteristics similar to those of the facility's computer.  One of the basic assumptions is that there will be enough random-access storage available to avoid the necessity for segmenting a constructed program in any fashion other than a trivial one.  While this assumption is somewhat unrealistic, it is intended to provide an opportunity to concentrate on the other aspects of program construction. The programming system should stress the discovery in source program statements of as many errors as possible, before attempting to construct an object program.  Among the computer characteristics which are advocated are a program interrupt scheme, a large set of characters, and indirect addressing."}

Given a list that is no longer needed, it is desired to erase just those parts that do not overlap other lists. In LISP, McCarthy employs an elegant but inefficient solution to the problem.

Since English words form only a sparse set of all possible alphabetic combinations, present methods are inefficient when computer systems are substituted for these terminals.  Using numeric representations of entire words or common phrases (rather than character-by-character representations) requires approximately one-third of present transmission time.  This saving is reflected in overall costs. Other benefits accrue in code and language translation schemes. Provision is made for transmission of purely numeric and/or binary streams, and for single character-transmission of non-dictionary words such as the names of people or places."}

The scheduling routine must be capable of extremely rapid execution if it is not to prove self-defeating. The construction of a schedule entails determining which programs are to be run concurrently and which sequentially with respect to each other.  A concise scheduling algorithm is described which tends to minimize the time for executing the entire pending workload (or any subset of it), subject to external constraints such as precedence, urgency, etc.  The algorithm is applicable to a wide class of machines."}

The message itself is arranged (conceptually) into a multidimensional rectangular array.  The processes of encoding and error detection are based upon parity evaluations along prescribed dimensions of the array.  Effectiveness of the codes is increased by introducing a \"system check bit\", which is essentially a parity check on the other parity bits.  Only three-dimensional codes are discussed in this paper with parity evaluations along the horizontal, the vertical, and one main diagonal.  However, the family of codes is not restricted to three dimensions, as evidenced by the discussion by Minnick and Ashenhurst on a similar multidimensional single-bit selection plan used for another purpose [6]. A four-dimensional code, correcting three and detecting four errors, has been developed; the extension to higher-dimensional codes with greater correction power is straightforward."}

Mappings of the total storage set (internal and external) of M into the direct address set of M' are introduced.  A program sequence P for M' is termed M-admissible (relative to a specific execution time period) if there is a mapping underwhich P and its effective data referents are all located in the direct address set of M.  Storage allocation is considered as a process of establishing for an arbitrary M' program  a sequence of mappings, a decoupling of the program into M-admissible subprograms and a linking set of interludes.  An existence proof in terms of a completely interpretive M program as indicated.  Some special cases are discussed.

This paper evaluates these two procedures on the basis of expected loss of computer time and develops a decision rule for selecting the optimum procedure.  The rule depends critically on the number of times the tape being written will be used in the future.  In the case where the optimum procedure is to bypass an area, a second decision-the size of the area to be bypassed-is necessary.

A set of rules for writing and using logic tables is explained by means of some simple examples.  Then the logic structure of a vending machine is given in which two logic tables are used.  Logic tables are two-dimensional in nature, enabling us to fully express and consider both the sequential and parallel aspects of logic.

{"_row":"321\tKnuth, D. E.;Merner, J. N.;\tALGOL 60 Confidential\t1961-06\tThe ALGOL 60 Report,* when first encountered, seems to describe a very complex language which will be difficult to learn.  The \"metalinguistic formulae\" admirably serve the purpose of precisely specifying a language, but they are certainly not very readable for a beginner.  However, experience has shown that once the report is explained it is in fact easy to learn ALGOL and to write algorithms in it.  The language is so general and powerful it can handle an enormous class of problems.  It is not hard to learn those parts of ALGOL present in other compiler languages: how to write assignment and go to and for statements, etc.  Indeed, a lot of the unnecessary restrictions imposed by other compiling languages have finally been lifted.  But ALGOL also allows many unobvious things to be written, as we will see later, and herein lies a problem: ALGOL seems to have become too general. So many restrictions have been lifted that a lot of technical details crop up which are hard to learn and to use correctly.  In this paper some of the more obscure features of the language are considered and their usefulness is discussed.  Remarks are based on the authors' interpretations of the ALGOL 60 Report."}

These incompatibilities are currently resolved by manually setting up the computer for each system as required. The following set of conventions is being considered to minimize computer set-up time.

An 80-column IBM card is divided into two fields-reference material field (columns 1-67) and identification field (columns 68-80).  The format for the reference material is flexible, while the format for the identification is rigid.  The reference material includes basically an index, title, source, class, summary and cross reference for each entry. The identification includes basically codes for a matrix of descriptors, an entry number, and the kind, major interest, and source of the reference.  The identification also provides a choice to identify material for personal as well as general files.  Since this card format is sufficient to identify the material normally associated with reference files for books, articles, programming terms, hardware terms, equipment, machine systems, abbreviations, etc., it is suitable as a standard for card reference files in information processing."}

The underlying problem is that of making nearly maximum use of items of identifying information that are individually unreliable but that may collectively be of considerable discriminating power.

{"_row":"441\tKahn, A. B.;\tTopological Sorting of Large Networks\t1962-11\tTopological Sorting is a procedure required for many problems involving analysis of networks. An example of one such problem is PERT.  The present paper presents a very general method for obtaining topological order.  It permits treatment of larger networks than can be handled on present procedures and achieves this with greater efficiency.  Although the procedure can be adapted to any machine, it is discussed in terms of the 7090.  A PERT network of 30,000 activities can be ordered in less than one hour of machine time.  The method was developed as a byproduct of procedures needed by Westinghouse, Baltimore.  It has not been programmed and at present there are no plans to implement it.  In regard to the techniques described, Westinghouse's present and anticipated needs are completely served by the Lockheed program, which is in current use."}

In order to solve the normal equations and evaluate the precision measures of the resulting parameters, inversion of this matrix of coefficients is required.  Many available procedures for matrix inversion do not take advantage of the symmetry.  Thus, when programmed for a high-speed computer, all n^2 elements must be stored and manipulated, whereas only (n + 1)/2 of them are independent. In order to allow a computer of given memory capacity to handle a larger matrix, the following procedure for inverting a symmetric matrix has been devised."}

The problem comprises the determination, given N, of the N points of subdivision of a given interval (a,B) and the corresponding line segments, that give the best least squares fit to a function g(x) in the interval. Bellman confined himself primarily to the analytical derivation, suggesting briefly, however, how the solution of the equation derived for each particular point of subdivision u(i) could be reduced to a discrete search.  In this paper, the computational procedure is considered more fully, and the similarities to some of Stone's equations are indicated. It is further shown that an equation for u(i) involving no minimization may be found.  In addition, it is shown how Bellman's method may be applied to the curve-fitting problem when the additional constraints are added that the ends of the line segments must be on the curve."}

In vital and health records, however, a unique number is generally not preassigned to an individual for purposes of reporting services received to the health department.  In order to determine whether different physician reports refer to the same individual, name and other identification must be compared.  This is a laborious operation which is subject to various errors because of name misspellings, changes of name upon marriage, and other problems.  We are interested in the maintenance of a psychiatric case register in Maryland, where many of the reports from over a hundred psychiatric agencies refer to the same patient. These records must be linked in order to provide unduplicated counts of individuals under care and longitudinal records of psychiatric history.  An earlier paper [1] describes our general procedures for register maintenance by use of a digital computer (Honeywell 800).

The need for such a technique often arises in testing the performance of data processing and engineering systems, where inputs corrupted with correlated noise (of a known form) are required.  The technique is quite simple and produces strict-sense stationary noise which agrees approximately with R(t), the prescribed auto-covariance function (acf), over an interval [-T(0), T(0)]. The method consists of approximating the spectral density by a periodic process with spectral lines, and then synthesizing the periodic noise with random phases and appropriate amplitudes.  In order to simplify discussion of the statistical properties of the noise generated, the technique is first presented in terms of exact harmonic analysis.  In practice, discrete harmonic analysis as presented in the third section is used."}

If the solution of the above equation for Zm,  Zm=N(Z1,...;A1,...) gives rise to a function N which is nonlinear in the Ai, then one may rely on a version of Gaussian regression [1,2] for an iteration scheme that converges to a minimizing set of values.

R.;\tInitial Experience With an Operating Multiprogramming System\t1962-05\tThe Lewis Research Center has been using various forms and degrees of program simultaneity in the operation of its modified Sperry-Rand Univac Scientific Model 1103 computer during the last five years.  This simultaneity has evolved from an initial achievement of self-searching input and output to the automatic time sharing of independently coded problems.  Several important machine and program system modifications were necessary to accomplish this evolution.  Several additional modifications, although not required, were added to facilitate ease of coding and operation.  All modifications had to proceed at a relatively temperate pace to insure that the basic data-reduction work load of the computing center was completed on schedule.  Some educationally valuable mistakes were made, and their suggested cures often pointed the way to useful future improvements or emphasized some of the basic principles of a multiprogramming system.  The material that follows is a description of the evolution of the programming and hardware system which has developed into the present multiprogramming system at Lewis research Center."}

The means of performing the transformation of a set of indices locating on array element in n-space to the location (address) of the element in its storage vector is the subject of this paper.

This experience has shown there is no inherent difficulty in \"building compilers with compilers\"; indeed, it pointed out many advantages in using a POL for constructing programming systems.  This report presents the results of a project completed in May, 1961 in which the NELIAC system was used to generate a compiler for the IBM 1401.  The 1401 compiler, which runs on the 7090 and produces 1401 programs, was described in the NELIAC language and generated with 7090 NELIAC system.

The industry is highly regulated by government and, hence, is subject to many statutes and regulations. It also is affected by important common law rules established by courts.  The legal ramifications involve not only the mechanization itself, but also the very significant, economically attractive phenomenon of off premises processing.  It is essential to identify and provide for many legal aspects right now, before systems and practices crystallize, in order to avoid the later impact of unanticipated physical complications and expense.  The legal aspects of computerization in the banking business are especially diverse.  In some states, there might be the basic question whether banks are authorized by law to invest in the new facilities, either directly or through cooperatives.  More challenging are questions relating to off-premises processors, particularly with respect to the obligation not to disclose information concerning a bank's customers, the adequacy of fidelity bond coverage, the extent of liability for improper refusal to pay a check, and susceptibility to regulation by government agencies.  Also pertinent is the propriety of data processing by banks for nonbank entities and particularly of the rendering of that service without charge for bank depositors."}

The codes, although constructed as part of a computerized hospital simulation, have been able to handle the results of every laboratory test that they have encountered.  The unique feature of these codes is that they can accept conventionally recorded qualitative as well as quantitative test results. Consequently, clinical test results need not be arbitrarily stratified, standardized, or altered in any way to be coded.  This paper describes how the codes were developed and presents a listing of the urin analysis codes.  Five criteria used in developing the codes are outlined and the problem of multiple-synonymous terminology is discussed.  A solution to the problem is described.  Flexible, computer-produced, composite laboratory reports are also discussed, along with reproduction of such a report. The paper concludes that even though many problems remain unsolved, the next ten years could witness the emergence of a practical automated information system in the laboratory."}

A.;\tUse of the Disk File on Stretch\t1963-10\tThe paper begins by briefly describing the Stretch (IBM 7030) computer with special emphasis given to the organization and operation of its input-output equipment.  Physical characteristics of the two-disk system (4,194,304 72-bit words, 8 usec-per-word transmission rate, etc.) are noted.  Timing limitations due to arm motion and disk rotation are discussed. Applications of disk usage are discussed separately for problem programs and for systems programs such as compilers and the supervisory program. Approximately 260,000 words of disk storage are reserved for the storage of systems programs and the subroutine library.  Problem programs, however, are not currently filed on the disk.  Certain programming techniques are discussed for transmitting words between disk and core storage with minimum delaying and interruption of the arithmetic unit.  Dumps on disk are considered for both recovery from computer malfunction and for mathematical or physical developments during the calculation.  Some comments are made regarding the reliability, economics, utility and weaknesses or limitations of the disk system.  Several possible future applications are noted which appear to have disk connotations."}

The system includes over 200 remote Input Stations which collect and transmit Company operating data to a central Data Processing Center.  Two RCA 301 EDP Systems are used to record and control the flow of data transmitted to the Data Processing Center. A large capacity RCA 366 Data Disc File is used to store information required to provide up-to-date information in response to inquiries received from remotely located Inquiry Stations.  In addition to storage of data on the disk files, the system automatically records all incoming and outgoing data on magnetic tape to be used as input to the Company's conventional off-line business data processing applications."}

A very high percentage of programmers have apparently entered their careers by accident; it has proven a happy choice for most and they expect to remain in the field during the next five years.  Their principal job satisfactions relate to the nature of their work, and mostfind their jobs offer high level of professional interest and good working conditions. Salary and advancement prospects, however,are not as satisfactory.  More than half report a positive attitude toward programmers and programming on the part of their organizations.  Turnover among themselves is attributed primarily to poor management-salary is seen as the principal motivating factor in turnover among other programmers.  Nature of the work offered and salary are principal determinants in accepting a new job.  Programmers are less mobile than expected. Programmers tend to see their colleagues in a favorable light, on the whole.  Personalities seem to vary with function, systems programmers differing from applications programmers.  Four principal problems for programming in the immediate future are listed by participants: languages, personnel, various specific applications and techniques, and building programming as a profession."}

To avoid a need to resort to optimum programming techniques and to increase its overall efficiency the computer has also been given a 224-word ferrite core store from which the program is obeyed.  Transfers between the core and drum stores and to and from the twin paper-tape input and output channels are all available autonomously (concurrently, time-shared). Multiplication and division orders are also autonomous, so that the machine may be executing up to three orders simultaneously.  All functions naturally are interlocked. A number of other advanced orders and facilities are also incorporated.In particular, an \"Execute\" order permits a temporary jump for up to four orders and a second modifier register permits double modification in general and relative addressing of subroutines in particular.  Thus the overall effective speed of the machine is muchhigher than its basic specification would lead one to expect and its design indicates one way in which the concepts of time sharing may be incorporated in \"low-cost\" computers."}

{"_row":"849\tSussenguth Jr., E. H.;\tUse of Tree Structures for Processing Files\t1963-05\tIn data processing problems, files are frequently used which must both be searched and altered. Binary search techniques are efficient for searching large files, but the associated file organization is not readily adapted to the file alterations.  Conversely, a chained file allocation permits efficient alteration but cannot be searched efficiently. A file organized into a tree-like structure is discussed, and it is shown that such a file may both be searched and altered with times proportional to slog(s)N, where N is the number of file items and s is a parameter of the tree.  It is also shown that optimizing the value of s leads to a search time which is only 25 per cent slower than the binary search.  The tree organization employs two data chains and may be considered to be a compromise between the organizations for the binary search and the chained file.  The relation of the tree organization to multidimensional indexing and to the trie structure is also discussed."}

This is particularly true in the case of sorting.  In a tape-oriented system, the major sorting problem is that of minimizing merge time despite the limited orders of merge possible. In contrast, sorting in a random access-oriented system encourages the selection of the optimum order of merge from many possible orders.  The latter problem is discussed in this paper, along with criteria developed for determining the optimum order of merge according to the various properties of random access storage devices.  Attention is also given to the problem of key sorting versus record sorting and the possibly serious disadvantage of key sorting on a random access system."}

In the present paper successive models are developed to extend the method to the fitting of broken plane segments to surfaces z=g(x,y) defined over certain types of subareas of the (x,y)-space. The first model considers a rectangular area, with the constraint that the plane segments are defined over a grid in the (x,y)-space.

The approximations and techniques suggested by Maehly are equally applicable to the second large computer in the CDC line, the 3600.  Unlike the 1604, however, the 3600 has built-in double-precision floating-point arithmetic. The present work, largely inspired by the successes of Maehly and his associates, concerns the extension of one of Maehly's ideas to a double-precision subroutine for the 3600."}

To handle the complexities arising from varying thermal-relaxation times of concentric insulating layers, a computer program was developed which gives the temperature distribution of the system as a function of radius and time.  This distribution is corrected at each step by a subroutine which calculates the instantaneous chemical state of there action, as well as the heat produced by this reaction. The program is based on a direct statement of Fourier's law of heat conduction and the chemical rate equation to provide a \"bookkeeping law\" to follow the reactants and the flow of heat packets, in such a way that the computer continually stores the heat distribution.  A computer analysis method is here regarded as one in which the physical laws of a process are used explicitly in the program. Usually this results in by passing much of the mathematical procedures conventionally used.  The program was tested against some known exact solutions of the heat equation and gave identical results, and compared well with experimental data of a known biochemical reaction. The construction of computer programs based on the direct statement of the physical laws is a principle of general applicability which has been applied to several other physical phenomena."}

It no longer is adequate merely to reduce a mathematical algorithm (i.e. the simplex method) to a computer code.  An advanced code must cope with such a variety of situations that the respective computer subprograms must be organized into an integrated system.  Emphasis in this paper is devoted to the underlying principles upon which future linear programming systems must be based.  These viewpoints are influenced by the new demands that applications within the petroleum industry are placing on such systems.  Some of the components of such a system are: translation of problem statement in terms of basic data to linear programming matrix coefficients, data transmission for direct computer entry, data file at the computer center, data processing and editing prior to solving the simplex algorithm, an efficient and reliable code for solving the above-mentioned algorithm, and flexible means for summarizing the results."}

Important common features of list-processing languages are reviewed: forms of data structures which are manipulated, necessity for dynamic allocation of storage, use of pushdown stores, and use of recursive operations.  Principal differences between the four languages under consideration are detailed: representations of data, both by the programmer and within the machine; methods for storage allocation; programming formalisms and special processes available, including arithmetic facilities; and usability in terms of availability, documentation, learning aids and debugging facilities.  A rough comparison shows that all the languages discussed have approximately the same speed.

{"_row":"1135\tLombardi, L. A.;\tA General Business-Oriented Language Based on Decision Expressions*\t1964-02\tThe structure of a digital compute programming language which covers a wide class of business and file processing applications is presented.  Such a structure, based on identifying and incorporating into a compiler the aspects common to all processes of such class, permits writing extremely compact programs, even for comparatively complex applications, in terms of tables of control expressions which express only information characteristic of the particular application.  Furthermore,local changes of a process (e.g. changes affecting only one of the output files involved) can be effected by local modifications in the program (e.g. modification of only one entry of the tables).  This structure also allows for inexpensive preparation of loading-speed compilers which translate the source programs into efficient machine codes. The approach adopted here departs from conventional mechanical language design philosophies.  It stresses the structural analysis of the class of processes to be represented in the languages, as opposed to emphasizing formal (i.e., contents-independent) syntactical definitions. It relies exclusively on nonprocedural representation of process as sets (tables) of relations between data and results (there are no control statements such as GO TO, etc.), instead of using procedure descriptions (which are one-to-one translations of flowcharts).  Here an invariant pattern of procedure is identified as characteristic of the class of all batch file processes.  This new philosophy has the potential to overcome well-known deficiencies of other business-oriented languages and fully meets the requirements set by CODASYL for such languages, including machine-independence."}

Results show that the values of the fitted parameters are very sensitive to variations in the fitting procedure.  Therefore great care very sensitive to variations in the fitting procedure.  Therefore great care must be exercised in identifying such values with physical constants.  Although the values of functions derived from these fitted parameters which can definitely be associated with physical entities are generally more stable under variations in the fitting techniques, error bounds can be so large that no great confidence can be placed even in them.

Intermediate machines can be created by adjoining on infinite-state memory to a finite-state machine and then performing any or all of the following: (1) restrict the manner in which the unbounded portion of the memory can be accessed, (2) bound the number of steps allowed for a computation by some increasing recursive function of the length of the input, (3) restrict the total amount of memory available in the same manner.  Examples from all three classes and their properties are discussed."}

R.;\tExperiments with a Deductive Question-Answering Program\t1965-12\tAs an investigation in artificial intelligence, computer experiments on deductive question-answering were run with a LISP program called DEDUCOM, an acronym for DEDUctive COMmunicator. When given 68 facts, DEDUCOM answered 10 questions answerable from the facts. A fact tells DEDUCOM either some specific information or a method of answering a general kind of question. Some conclusions drawn in the article are: (1) DEDUCOM can answer a wide variety of questions.  (2) A human can increase the deductive power of DEDUCOM by telling it more facts.  (3) DEDUCOM can write very simple programs (it is hoped that this ability is the forerunner of an ability to self-program, which is a way to learn).  (4)DEDUCOM's search procedure at present has two bad defects: some questions answerable from the given facts cannot be answered and some other answerable questions can be answered only if the relevant facts are given in the \"right\" order. (6) At present, DEDUCOM's method of making logical deductions in predicate calculus has two bad defects: some facts have to be changed to logically equivalent ones before being given to DEDUCOM, and some redundant facts have to be given to DEDUCOM."}

The algorithm finds a local minimum of F by evaluating the set {Delta F} of the increments corresponding to a certain set of exchanges of two elements.Then the exchange corresponding to the least negative increment of {Delta F} is performed.  The process is iterated and stopped when the set of the increments is a positive or empty set, which, it is proved, corresponds to a minimum.

The characteristics used to form word classes are the depth in the dependency tree of each word, the direction of its governor and the same features for each of its immediate neighbors. Syntactic rules of combination show the relation of a word to its governor in the depth pattern of the sentence.  The system was tested on 400 elementary basic English sentences including 300 used earlier by Knowlton in a different learning parser of all 400 sentences.  After experience with 300 sentences it was able to generalize with 77 percent accuracy to the next 100. In accumulative learning trials after the first 200 sentences it averaged a probability of .9 for accurately parsing each new sentence it encountered. It was concluded that the system is adequate for learning to parse the bulk of basic English but that further development is required before conclusions about its application to ordinary English can be stored.

The program operates at relatively high speed in only a limited storage space. About half of the word-events in a corpus are identified through the use of a small dictionary of function words and frequently occurring lexical words.  Some suffix tests and logical-decision rules are employed to code additional words.  Finally, the remaining words are assigned to one class or another on the basis of the most probable form classes to occur within the already identified contexts.  The conditional probabilities used as a basis for this coding were empirically derived from a separate hand-coded corpus.On preliminary trials, the accuracy of the coder was 91% to 93%, with obvious ways of improving the algorithm being suggested by an analysis of the results."}

By judicious control of man-machine communication requirements, improved results over conventional engineering design processes are possible.  An English-like input language, tailored for use by draftsmen and designers, will describe the part and specify the output desired.  One approach to the mathematical model consists of a group of surface-defining quadric equations, which are created by a system of modular subprogram.  Other subprograms will convert the mathematical model into instructions for driving automatic drafting machines and numerical controlled machine tools. Physical part characteristics, such as center of gravity, can be computed by subprograms and used in dynamic analysis work.  The proposed overall system is presented and experiments and demonstrations are discussed."}

First a model for computer languages and compute behavior is described, based on the notions of functional application and functional abstraction, but also having analogues for imperative language features. Then this model is used as an \"abstract object language\" into which ALGOL 60 is mapped.  Many of ALGOL 60's features emerge as particular arrangements of a small number of structural rules, suggesting new classifications and generalizations.  The correspondence is first described informally, mainly by illustrations. The second part of the paper gives a formal description, i.e. an \"abstract compiler\" into the \"abstract objct language.\"  This is itself presented in a \"purely functional\" notation, that is one using only application and abstraction."}

Y(m), (m >= O) where Z and Y(i) are intermediate symbols and c a terminal symbol.  Since the predictive analyzer at Harvard uses a standard-form grammar, it can accept the language of any context-free Grammar G, given an equivalent standard-form grammar Gs.  The structural descriptions SD(Gs,X) assigned to a given sentence X by the predictive analyzer, however, are usually different from the structural descriptions SD(G,X) assigned to the same sentence by the original context-free grammar G from which Gs is derived.  In Section 1, an algorithm, originally due to Abbott is described standard-form grammar each of whose rules is in standard form, supplemented by additional information describing its derivation from the original context-free grammar. A technique for performing the SD(Gs,X) to SD(G,X) transformation effectively is also described.  In section 2, the augmented predictive analyzer as a parsing algorithm for arbitrary context-free languages is compared with two other parsing algorithms: a selective top-to-bottom algorithm similar to Irons' \"error correcting parse algorithm\" and an immediate constituent analyzer which is an extension of Sakai-Cocke's algorithm for normal grammars.

The difficulty lies in whether to attach the else to the first if or to the second one.  Existing solutions to the problem are either ambiguous or unnecessarily restrictive. Let Sand S1 be statements.  We define S to be closed if \"S else S1\" is not a statement, and to be open if \"S else S1\" is a statement.  Thus an unconditional statement is  a closed statement.  Open and closed conditional statements are defined by syntax equations in such a way as to preserve openness and closure. In each case, an else must always be preceded by a closed statement.  It is shown that the syntax equations are unambiguous, and that may change in the statement types required within the syntax equations would lead to either ambiguity or unnecessary restriction."}

The usual means for increasing this capacity is to incorporate engineering or hardware improvements.  In this paper the problem is attacked not by changing the drum, but rather by modifying the manner in which it operates.  At the outset, a drum is given a functional definition.  Then a simple design scheme (Eschenbach) is introduced which enormously increases the rate of accessing for drums so defined.  This is shown to enable a system to perform a job by employing fewer or less expensive drums.  It is suggested that although the design scheme has a specific use, the method underlying it has more general applicability.  The question of the efficacy of the drum scheme is then raised.  To deal with this, a standard of efficiency is developed in light of realistic real-time circumstances.  The drum scheme is then modelled in a manner which permits it to be analyzed as a problem in queueing theory. Thus one is enabled to ascertain whether the drum scheme is efficient enough for its application.  Again, whereas the analysis of the drum scheme has a specific use, the methods underlying it have more general applicability."}

Both kinds of processing draw upon a common store of data contained in the direct access central file.  This data base includes indexes which facilitate cross referencing of account information so that all relationships between bank and customer may be discerned.

To explore the prospects of such a step, the authors attempted in 1963 to prepare a general program for deriving microsentences from longer sentences that had been syntactically analyzed by the Harvard Multipath Analysis Program.  The basic idea was to extract the subject, verb and object (if any) of each clause and to reassemble these materials into a grammatical microsentence.  A program is described in this paper, which was designed to operate on the tree structure output of the analyzer, and the microsentences that were produced are exhibited.

{"_row":"1470\tRaphael, B.;\tThe Structure of Programming Languages\t1966-03\tThe following are identified as major components of every programming language: (1) the elementary program statement, (2) mechanisms for linking elementary statements together, (3) the means by which a program can obtain data inputs.  Several alternative forms of each of these components are described, compared and evaluated.  Many examples, frequently from list processing languages, illustrate the forms described.  Elementary program statements usually take the form of commands, requirements, or implicit specifications.  A command is an imperative statement that commands the action to be taken.  A requirement describes the effect to be achieved without saying anything about the actions to be taken.  An implicit specification is similar to a requirement, but the programmer must understand what actions will be taken to achieve the desired effect.  Subroutines may be entered explicitly, by execute call, or by function composition.  Explicitly called subroutines generally require special linkage conventions.  An execute subroutine call is syntactically indistinguishable from a basic instruction of the programming language. Function composition is a convenient alternative to the explicit call.  The three principal ways of getting inputs for routines are (1) by referring to the data itself, (2) by referring to the data by a \"name\", and (3) by referring to it implicitly by means of variables or functions.  Names are useful entry points into permanent data structures, but can be error-causing distractions in other contexts. The author discusses advantages, disadvantages, and factors influencing the choice of a form of component for a language.   He concludes by suggesting the evolution of programming languages toward one which will permit all the most convenient ways of structuring programs, organizing systems, and referencing data."}

(This segmented division is denoted here as a (2, 1) precision basic division.) It is found that the normalization requirement could be narrowed down to a smaller range of divisors, provided the magnitude of the character next to the leading character of the divisor is known.  If, however, the normalization is to be eliminated one has to choose proper higher precision segments of operands for the basic division.  Also considered is the possibility of eliminating the normalization by an increase on the number of corrections on the quotient estimate got from a (2, 1) precision basic division.

This procedure makes use of a sentence recognition device for the class of grammars which will correctly decide between the grammatical and ungrammatical sentences of a natural language.  It is possible to make use of a recognition device of this sort for the following reason: Much data is fully expressible as a set of sentences in a natural language, a set which can be exhaustively and exclusively generated by a grammar.  Based upon the rules of this grammar, a sentence recognizer will evaluate sentences, questions in the normal situation.  Since the recognition function succeeds just in case the posed question is drawn from the set of sentences expressing the data, or, more correctly, is grammatical in terms of the grammar for this set of sentences, sentence recognition itself is a procedure for retrieving information. When the recognition function succeeds, its value represents the requested information."}

To illustrate the techniques involved, a digital computer has been used to derive the equations of motion of a point mass in a general orthogonal curvilinear coordinate system. Since this operation involves a formulation in terms of first- and second-order differential coefficients, it provides a good demonstration of a computer's capability to do non-numeric work and to assist in the formulation process which normally precedes the numerical data processing stage.

It can also be used to assist in the design and development of new time-sharing algorithms or techniques.  For the sake of efficiency and greater applicability, the model was implemented in a limited FORTRAN subset that is compatible with most FORTRAN IV compilers. The use of the simulation is demonstrated by a study of the IBM 360/67 time-sharing system."}

The teaching system (ABAC-II) was written to run under the operating system (IBSYS) for the IBM 7044 Graphic System.  Because the teaching system automatically terminated and rescheduled itself, a student studying a course presented at a cathode-ray display terminal could switch readily between student mode and programmer mode.  During the latter, the full resources of the operating system (language processors, compilers, library and user's programs) were at his disposal.  He could for example, write, assemble, debug, and execute at the terminal a program written in any language processed by the operating system. A course could therefore include text material interleaved with programming problems which the student could solve without leaving the terminal.  Exercises in simulation and gaming could also be provided.

It consists in reducing to one level a nonhomogeneous store composed of fast (core) and slow (disk or drum) memories.  The space available in slow memory is divided into pages each containing a given number of machine words.  The reduction to a one-level memory is performed by a program which leaves the most often called pages in the fast memory. When a new page from slow store is requested, the page in core having the longest period of inactivity is transferred back to the slow store.  The complete scheme has been implemented in connection with a LISP embedding into ALGOL, using an IBM 7044 with 32k of core memory and disks.  Gains in memory space were about 100-fold.  As often happens in programming applications the price of the additional space is computer time.  Although the disks have an access time 10^4 times slower than core, tests indicate that the actual slow down varied from 3 to 10, depending on the number of pages available in the fast store."}

T.;\tAutomatic Generation of Efficient Lexical Processors Using Finite State Techniques\t1968-12\tThe practical application of the theory of finite-state automata to automatically generate lexical processors is dealt with in this tutorial article by the use of the AED RWORD system, developed at M.I.T. as part of the AED-1 system.  This system accepts as input description of the multicharacter items or of words allowable in a language given in terms of a subset of regular expressions. The output of the system is a lexical processor which reads a string of characters and combines them into the items as defined by the regular expressions.  Each output item is identified by a code number together with a pointer to a block of storage containing the characters and character count in the item.  The processors produced by the system are based on finite-state machines. Each state of a \"machine\" corresponds to a unique condition in the lexical processing of a character string.  At each state a character is read, and the machine changes to a new state.  At each transition appropriate actions are taken based on the particular character read.  The system has been in operation since 1966, and processors generated have compared favorably in speed to carefully hand-coded programs to accomplish the same task.  Lexical processors for AED-O and MAD are among the many which have been produced.  The techniques employed are independent of the nature of the items being evaluated.  If the word \"events\" is substituted for character string, these processors may be described as generalized decision-making mechanisms based upon an ordered sequence of events.  This allows the system to be used in a range of applications outside the area of lexical processing.  However convenient these advantages may be, speed is the most important consideration. In designing a system for automatic generation of a lexical processor, the goal was a processor which completely eliminated backup or rereading, which was nearly as fast as hand-coded processors, which would analyze the language and detect errors, and which would be convenient and easy to use."}

It is quite difficult to characterize a particular user, but rather easy to characterize the entire user community. Based on the properties of this community we have postulated a hypothetical \"virtual console.\" No claim is made that a virtual console behaves like any actual console, but the entire collection of virtual consoles models the collection of actual consoles.  Using the model we answer questions like: How many processes are suspended waiting for console input?  What is the maximum rate at which a process can execute?  What bounds can be set on overall buffer requirements?  Answers to these and similar questions are needed in certain aspects of operating system design."}

A search program using the device has been operational since late 1963.  As an item is entered in the store, an 18-byte mask is created from the item's meaningful words using the inclusive OR operation.  If, at search time, the logical product (using the AND operation) of this mask and a similarly constructed question mask is not equal to the question mask, then one or more question words are not present in the store item. An equality is in conclusive; the words of the store item must be unpacked and compared with question words.  The present store is made up of over 600,000 subject index entries estimated to average 60 characters each.  Longer texts, such as abstracts, could be handled by multiple masks."}

{"_row":"1725\tWolinsky, A.;\tA Simple Proof of Lewin's Ordered-Retrieval Theorem for Associative Memories\t1968-07\tAn efficient method of ordered retrieval of binary words from an associative memory, as described by Lewin, is based on the use of special readout circuits which indicate the digit values present in the individual digit columns of the memory.  Thus the circuits indicate whether the individual digit columns contain digits of both values, or of only one value, or contain no digits at all (i.e. that the memory is empty).  The use of these circuits, which in this paper are termed column value indicators, reduces considerably the number of memory accesses necessary to retrieve in order a number of distinct words from the memory.  Lewin proves that, for the readout by the described method of m distinct binary words, 2m - 1 memory accesses are necessary.

In the cases where the S(ij) are estimated directly, the structure of the whole program must be generally taken into account; therefore it is very difficult for the programmer and/or the translator to obtain a good estimation of the S(ij).  It is easier to estimate not S(ij) but the quantities P(ij)=S(ij)*C(i)/SUM[S(ij), j=1,N], where C(i) is an arbitrary positive constant for each i.  Although the P(ij) are, for each i, proportional to S(ij), the estimation of P(ij) is easier, because we must estimate only the \"probabilities\" of events where instruction i is executed after instruction I(i).  This estimation can often be done without considering the structure of the whole program.  In the first part of the paper, using the theory of the Markov chains, an algorithm for the computation of the S(ij) from the P(ij) is found, and some ways of obtaining estimates of the P(ij) are given.

{"_row":"1769\tHarder, E. L.;\tThe Expanding World of Computers\t1968-04\tThe onward sweep of automatic processing of information is impeded by nine principal barriers: geography, cost, problem complexity, man-machine communication, inadequate sensors, lack of understanding, distance, time, and size.  The main incentive for breaching these barriers is the universal need for processing information, ever more urgent as the greater part of human work activity changes from production to service.  Computer developments in hardware, programming, time-sharing, education, data communication, and displays are judged by how effectively they remove these barriers, and their barrier-smashing potentialities indicate continued rapid expansion.  Problem-oriented languages are particularly effective over the entire front.  Online computers and time-sharing also rate high by this measure.  Education and increased understanding are basic to all progress with the computer.

These programs are actually proceeding intermittently and singly, according to eligibility (readiness to proceed) and priority. It is useful to be able to represent them as proceeding continuously and simultaneously, each at an effective rate, which may be a fraction of that which it would enjoy in the absence of the other programs.  The effective progress rate of each program is sensitive to many detailed characteristics of itself and its co-residents and simulation has been the best available method of predicting it.  This paper presents the results of progress in developing an alternative to simulation, a simulation-tested iterative computation of these rates under certain situations.  The algorithm is sensitive to most of the factors that control the phenomenon, including nonquantitative or topological features of the programs' structures."}

{"_row":"1811\tRosenfeld, J. L.;\tA Case Study in Programming for Parallel-Processors\t1969-12\tAn affirmative partial answer is provided to the question of whether it is possible to program parallel-processor computing systems to efficiently decrease execution time for useful problems.  Parallel-processor systems are multiprocessor systems in which several of the processors can simultaneously execute separate tasks of a single job, thus cooperating to decrease the solution time of a computational problem. The processors have independent instruction counters, meaning that each processor executes its own task program relatively independently of the other processors.  Communication between cooperating processors is by means of data in storage shared by all processors.  A program for the determination of the distribution of current in an electrical network was written for a parallel-processor computing system, and execution of this program was simulated.  The data gathered from simulation runs demonstrate the efficient solution of this problem, typical of a large class of important problems.  It is shown that, with proper programming, solution time when N processors are applied approaches 1/N times the solution time for a single processor, while improper programming can actually lead to an increase of solution time with the number of processors. Stability of the method of solution was also investigated."}

One of the computers serves as the master or control computer and supervises the collection and distribution of messages from and to the remote terminals.  In the simplest form there is a disk drive for each connected terminal.  A crosspoint switching network allows any such disk drive to be connected to any computer. Thus, while each active terminal user \"occupies\" a dedicated disk drive, he may share the computer with many other terminal users in a simple manner. The ratio of users to computers is dependent on both the size and power of the machines used and the computation requirements of the particular mix of users. This system organization is inherently a simpler and therefore more reliable approach to time-sharing computers and has the potential of a highly available system at relatively low cost.  Economic configurations are possible for a range of systems sizes that span at least one order of magnitude.  Finally, problem programs developed by remote terminal users can be run on a dedicated batch system if compatible computers are used."}

A critique of the first three systems is based on actual experience with a large overlaid trajectory simulation program; a short history and description of this program is presented.  A standardization of minimum capabilities for loaders is recommended so that programs which must operate under more than one computer system may be easily converted and maintained.  A proposal that overlay software incorporates a memory occupation specification concept instead of the conditional tree structure is delineated.  This concept provides more efficient and cost-effective utilization of the memory as well as increased flexibility in program structure."}
{"_row":"1846\tParnas, D. L.;\tOn Simulating Networks of Parallel Processes in Which Simultaneous Events May Occur\t1969-09\tSome of the problems of simulating discrete event systems, particularly computer systems, on a conventional digital computer are dealt with.  The systems are assumed to be described as a network of interconnected sequential processes.  Briefly reviewed are the common techniques used to handle such simulations when simultaneous events do not occur, can be ignored, or can be handled by simple priority rules.  Following this, the problem of dealing with simultaneous events in separate processes is introduced. An abstraction of this problem is developed which admits solution for a majority of commonly encountered problems.  The technique will either find a method of simulating the parallel events or report that none can be found.  In some of the latter cases it is shown to be possible to find a solution by extending the information available to the solution technique, but in many cases the technique becomes computationally unfeasible when the additional information is provided."}
{"_row":"1847\tPaton, K.;\tAn Algorithm for Finding a Fundamental Set of Cycles of a Graph\t1969-09\tA fast method is presented for finding a fundamental set of cycles for an undirected finite graph.  A spanning tree is grown and the vertices examined in turn, unexamined vertices being stored in a pushdown list to await examination.  One stage in the process is to take the top element v of the pushdown list and examine it, i.e. inspect all those edges (v,z) of the graph for which z has not yet been examined.  If z is already in the tree, a fundamental cycle is added; if not, the edge (v,z) is placed in the tree.  There is exactly one such stage for each of the n vertices of the graph.  For large n, the store required in creases as n^2 and the time as n^g where g depends on the type of graph involved. g is bounded below by 2 and above by 3, and it is shown that both bounds are attained.  In terms of storage our algorithm is similar to that of Gotlieb and Corneil and superior to that of Welch; in terms of speed it is similar to that of Welch and superior to that of Gotlieb and Corneil.  Testsshow our algorithm to be remarkably efficient (g=2) on random graphs."}

{"_row":"1856\tQuillian, M. R.;\tThe Teachable Language Comprehender: A Simulation Program and Theory of Language\t1969-08\tThe Teachable Language Comprehender (TLC) is a program designed to be capable of being taught to \"comprehend\" English text.  When text which the program has not seen before is input to it, it comprehends that text by correctly relating each (explicit or implicit) assertion of the new text to a large memory. This memory is a \"semantic network\" representing factual assertions about the world.  The program also creates copies of the parts of its memory which have been found to relate to the new text, adapting and combining these copies to represent the meaning of the new text.  By this means, the meaning of all text the program successfully comprehends is encoded into the same format as that of the memory.  In this form it can be added into the memory.  Both factual assertions for the memory and the capabilities for correctly relating text to the memory's prior content are to be taught to the program as they are needed. TLC presently contains a relatively small number of examples of such assertions and capabilities, but within the system, notations for expressing either of these are provided.  Thus the program now corresponds to a general process for comprehending language, and it provides a methodology for adding the additional information this process requires to actually comprehend text of any particular kind.  The memory structure and comprehension process of TLC allow new factual assertions and capabilities for relating text to such stored assertions to generalize automatically.  That is, once such an assertion or capability is put into the system, it becomes available to help comprehend a great many other sentences in the future. Thus the addition of a single factual assertion or linguistic capability will often provide a large increment in TLC's effective knowledge of the world and in its overall ability to comprehend text.  The program's strategy is presented as a general theory of language comprehension."}

The most striking result is the apparently general rule that rounding up requests for storage, to reduce the number of different sizes of blocks coexisting in storage, causes more loss of storage by increased internal fragmentation than is saved by decreased external fragmentation.  Described also are a method of segment allocation and an accompanying technique for segment addressing which take advantage of the above result.  Evidence is presented of possible advantages of the method over conventional paging techniques."}

Extensions of this technique to the control of crosstalk between routed interconnections and to the problem of obtaining 100 percent interconnect are also discussed."}

{"_row":"1936\tPatt, Y. N.;\tVariable Length Tree Structures Having Minimum Average Search Time\t1969-02\tSussenguth suggests in a paper (1963) that a file should be organized as a doubly-chained tree structure if it is necessary both to search and to update frequently.  Such a structure provides a compromise between the fast search/slow update characteristics of binary searching and the slow search/fast update characteristics of serial searching.  His method, however, contains the limiting restriction that all terminal nodes lie on the same level of the tree.  This paper considers the effect of relaxing this restriction. First, trees which have the property that a priori the filial set of each node is well defined are studied. It is proved that coding the nodes within each filial set with respect to the number of terminal nodes reachable from each is necessary and sufficient to guarantee minimum average search time.  Then the more general case (that is, where the entire structure of the tree is changeable) is treated.  A procedure is developed for constructing a tree with a minimum average search time.  A simple closed expression for this minimum average search time is obtained as a function of the number of terminal nodes.  The storage capacity required to implement the doubly-chained tree structure on a digital computer is also determined.  Finally, the total cost of the structure, using Sussenguth's cost criterion, is computed. It is shown that significant improvements in both the average search time and the total cost can be obtained by relaxing Sussenguth's restriction that all terminal nodes lie on the same level of the tree."}

Preliminary considerations narrow the choice of the best algorithm to Bezout's determinant and Collins' reduced polynomial remainder sequence (p.r.s.) algorithm.  Detailed tests performed on sample problems conclusively show that Bezout's determinant is superior in all respects except for univariate polynomials, in which case Collins' reduced p.r.s. algorithm is somewhat faster.

Y.;\tMulti-attribute Retrieval with Combined Indexes\t1970-11\tIn this paper a file organization scheme designed to replace the use of the popular secondary index filing scheme (or inverted files on secondary key fields) is described. Through the use of redundancy and storing keys (or access numbers of the records) that satisfy different combinations of secondary index values in \"buckets,\" it is possible to retrieve all keys satisfying any input query derived from a subset of fields by a single access to an index file, although each bucket may be used for many combinations of values and a combination of buckets may be required for a given query.  The method which, in its degenerate case, becomes the conventional secondary index filing scheme works similarly but has the following advantages: (1) the elimination of multiple accesses in many cases; (2) the elimination of false drops; (3) the elimination of computer time to perform intersection of key sets each qualified for one secondary index field only; and (4) the avoidance of long strings of keys when an index field appearing in a query has very few possible values.  Redundancy, in some cases, is the same as the secondary indexing method. In the general case, trade-off between the number of accesses for query and redundancy exists."}

{"_row":"1978\tSmith, L. B.;\tThe Use of Interactive Graphics To Solve Numerical Problems\t1970-10\tWith the advent of on-line (time-sharing) computer systems and graphic terminals, we have available a new dimension in numerical problem solving capabilities.  Rather than simply use the new power to achieve fast turnaround, we can develop interactive routines which are easy to use and also take advantage of the insight and visual capabilities of the human problem solver.  Several on-line systems for general purpose mathematical problem solving have already been implemented as well as some special purpose systems for solving problems in a particular area such as ordinary differential equations.  The advantage of restricting the problem area is that the interface with a user can be greatly simplified. In this paper we discuss some of the advantages accrued by such systems and design considerations for interactive routines.  Furthermore, an implementation of an on-line least squares data-fitting program, PEG, is presented with results obtained from empirical data.  In conclusion, area for future work in this field are discussed."}

The main contribution of this paper is another generalization of quicksort, which uses a bounding interval instead of a single element as bound.  This generalization turns out to be easy to implement in a computer program.  A numerical approximation shows that a = 1.140 for this version of quicksort compared with 1.386 for the original.

The system described is hardware-independent and has been implemented on a variety of installations, of different manufacturers, having diverse configurations.  The elements common to all types of data plots are outlined and the way in which these elements may be combined into a system based on simple modules is demonstrated. These modules are specified independently and are independent of the axis systems or other attributes of the plot.  This enables plots of any complexity to be constructed by adding or replacing modules.  The basic syntax of AMESPLOT is outlined, and a brief description is given of its current utility software, consisting of \"macros\" to produce self-scaled plots, formal tablets of text-interspersed with subplots, map coastlines, and 3-D plots.  The system was formulate d in a way such that the user could supply the minimum of information, and it should be fully integrable with user's program written in most conventional higher languages.  The functions of positioning, locating, and scaling (in the layout of multiple subplots) of axes, labels, and all other elements of the plot are handled automatically by the software system unless the user specifies otherwise.  The structuring of plots from multiple, independent, self-contained subplots is described. Transformation, projection, scaling, rotation, or shifting of entire plots or subplots by the action of one or more simple modules is possible.  The user may interact freely with AMESPLOT at three levels, enabling him to construct his own data markers, alphabetic characters, and transformations, and to produce a variety of artistic and other effects."}

One means that is suggested more and more frequently is a pricing procedure.  In this paper the manner in which one would like to allocate computing resources is considered, and then the extent to which a pricing mechanism fits this mold is discussed.  Inasmuch as pricing must serve as a rationing mechanism at times, consideration is given to the means by which prices can be adjusted flexibly in order to make a dynamic allocation of resources.  Consideration is also given to the means by which users can be insulated from the harmful effects of frequent price fluctuations.  Although the subject of pricing has been given a lot of attention recently, a number of misconceptions persist about its purpose and its operation.  An attempt is made to clarify some of these misunderstandings and to highlight the advantages and disadvantages and to highlight the advantages and disadvantages of pricing. Two illustrative pricing systems are also discussed in order to demonstrate the applicability of pricing in quite different environments."}

Two new hash-coding methods are examined and compared with a particular conventional hash-coding method. The computational factors considered are the size of the hash area (space), the time required to identify a message as a nonmember of the given set (reject time), and an allowable error frequency.  The new methods are intended to reduce the amount of space required to contain the hash-coded information from that associated with conventional methods.  The reduction in space is accomplished by exploiting the possibility that a small fraction of errors of commission may be tolerable in some applications, in particular, applications in which a large amount of data is involved and a core resident hash area is consequently not feasible using conventional methods.  In such applications, it is envisaged that overall performance could be improved by using a smaller core resident hash area in conjunction with the new methods and, when necessary, by using some secondary and perhaps time-consuming test to \"catch\" the small fraction of errors associated with new methods.  An example is discussed which illustrates possible areas of application for the new methods.  Analysis of the paradigm problem demonstrates that allowing a small number of test messages to be falsely identified as members of the given set will permit a much smaller hash area to be used without increasing reject time."}

R.;Rajaraman, V.;\tOn the Conversion of Decision Tables to Computer Programs\t1970-06\tThe use of execution time diagnostics in pinpointing ambiguities in decision tables is discussed.  It is pointed out that any attempt at resolving ambiguities at compile time will, in general, be impossible.  It is shown that, as a consequence, tree methods of converting decision tables to programs are inadequate in regard to ambiguity detection. Two algorithms for programming decision tables whose merits are simplicity of implementation and detection of ambiguities at execution time are presented. The first algorithm is for limited entry decision tables and clarifies the importance of proper coding of the information in the decision table.  The second algorithm programs a mixed entry decision table directly without going through the intermediate step of conversion to a limited entry form, thereby resulting in storage economy.  A comparison of the algorithms and others proposed in the literature is made.  Some features of a decision table to Fortran IV translator for the IBM 7044 developed by the authors are given."}

The feasibility of implementing such a system with a FORTRAN-like algebraic compiler as the object processor is considered.  Details of a specific word recognition program are given.  This technique depends on three simplifying restrictions, namely, a \"small\" vocabulary set, \"known\" speakers, and a \"moment of silence\" between each input word.  Experimental results are presented giving error rates for different experimental conditions as well as the machine resources required to accommodate several users at a time. The results show that at this time it is both economically and logically feasible to handle at least 40 users at a time with an IBM 360/65 computer."}

{"_row":"2060\tReynolds, J. C.;\tGEDANKEN-A Simple Typeless Language Based on the Principle of Completeness and the Reference Concept\t1970-05\tGEDANKEN is an experimental programming language with the following characteristics.  (1) Any value which is permitted in some context of the language is permissible in any other meaningful context.  In particular, functions and labels are permissible  results of functions and values of variables.  (2) Assignment and indirect addressing are formalized by introducing values, called reference, which in turn possess other values.  The assignment operation always affects the relation between some reference and its value,  (3) All compound data structures are treated as functions.  (4) Type declarations are not permitted.  The functional approach to data structures and the use of references insure that any process which accepts some data structure will accept any logically equivalent structure, regardless of its internal representation.  More generally, any data structure may be implicit; i.e. it may be specified by giving an arbitrary algorithm for computing or accessing its components.  The existence of label variables permits the construction of coroutines, quasi-parallel processes, and other unorthodox control mechanisms. A variety of programming examples illustrates the generality of the language. Limitations and possible extensions are discussed briefly."}

The notion of reduction class for a context-free grammar is then introduced and its connection with the structure of a bounded-context parser is indicated.  Next, pushdown automata which generate the different reduction classes of a context-free grammar are defined.  Finally, the algorithm is described; it essentially carries out an exhaustive study of all possible runs of the pushdown automata generating the reduction classes.

Segmentation techniques proposed by C. V.

This paper shows that expression execution time can be minimized only if consideration is given to the ordering of the subexpressions.  In particular, subexpressions should be executed in order of decreasing memory and processor time requirements.  This observation is valid for configurations ranging from a uniprocessor with an unbuffered main memory to multiprocessor with a \"cache\" buffer memory.

This analysis makes use of a particular distribution function.  An analysis of a completely different distribution is given which yields similar results.  This suggests that the results do not depend on a particular distribution function.  An optimum output buffer size is also determined.

Each subsystem is chosen from large numbers of alternatives; the selection is based on considerations such as system response time, system cost, and the distribution of data storage and processing between the graphics processor and its supporting data processing system.  The work reported here develops an objective, quantitative design procedure and helps give a better understanding of now to  configure display systems.  This is accomplished by means of a mathematical model of a computer driven graphics system.  The parameters of the model are functions of the capabilities of the graphics hardware and of the computational requirements of the graphics application. The model can be analyzed using numerical queueing analysis or simulation to obtain an average response time prediction.  By combining the model with an optimization, the best graphics system configuration, subject to a cost constraint, is found for several applications.  The optimum configurations are in turn used to find general display system design guidelines."}
{"_row":"2189\tHarada, K.;\tGeneration of Rosary Permutations Expressed in Hamiltonian Circuits\t1971-06\tSystematic generation of a specific class of permutations fundamental to scheduling problems is described.  In a nonoriented complete graph with n vertices, Hamitonian circuits equivalent to .5(n - 1)! specific permutations of n elements, termed rosary permutations, can be defined.  Each of them corresponds to two circular permutations which mirror-image each other, and is generated successively by a number system covering 3*4*...*(n-1) sets of edges. Every set of edges {E[k]}, 1 <= E[k] <= k, 3 <= k <= (n-1) is determined recursively by constructing a Hamiltonian circuit with k vertices from a Hamiltonian circuit with k-1 vertices, starting with the Hamiltonian circuit of 3 vertices.  The basic operation consists of transposition of a pair of adjacent vertices where the position of the pair in the permutation is determined by {E[k]}.  Two algorithms treating the same example for five vertices are presented.  It is very easy to derive all possible n! permutations  from the .5(n - 1 )! rosary permutations be cycling the permutations and by taking them in the reverse order-procedures which can be performed fairly efficiently by computer."}

{"_row":"2194\tRichards, D. L.;\tHow To Keep the Addresses Short\t1971-05\tAn algorithm is presented for minimizing the sum of the lengths of the blocks of coding produced by an assembler or compiler when (1) the length of each computer instruction is assumed to be either \"long\" or \"short\" (\"long,\" if the memory location addressed is more than a predetermined distance from the current location; \"short,\" otherwise), and (2) there are blocks of instructions whose beginnings (origins) are separated by prespecified amounts. For example, some computers permit either 8-bit addressing (interpreted relative to the location counter) or full 16-bit addressing of all of memory.  When assembling or compiling two or more blocks of instructions which have many mutual references in such a computer, there is no simple iterative procedure for keeping as many of the addresses short as possible.

The relation between the structure of the figure of merit and the complexity of the optimization process is then discussed.

It is also a subproblem in solving others, such as the warehouse distribution problem.  It has been attacked by many mathematical methods with but meager success.  Only for special forms of the problem or for problems with a moderate number of points can it be solved exactly, even if very large amounts of computer time are used.  Heuristic procedures have been proposed and tested with only slightly better results.  This paper describes a computer aided heuristic technique which uses only a modest amount of computer time in real-time to solve large (100-200) point problems.  This technique takes advantage of both the computer's and the human's problem-solving abilities.  The computer is not asked to solve the problem in a brute force way as in many of today's heuristics, but it is asked to organize the data for the human so that the human can solve the problem easily. The technique used in this paper seems to point to new directions in the field of man-machine interaction and in the field of artificial intelligence."}

This introduction gives a review of the current state of the art in these systems and discusses the differences and similarities between capabilities found in host language systems and those found in self-contained systems.  After some discussion of the problems of data independence and binding,the four user levels are identified and described.  Technical problems facing future designers are described.  The first of these is that of handling existing stored data and the next is that of providing more complex data structures than those already available in conventional programming languages.  The problem of high level interrogation and update functions acting on network structures is mentioned, followed by a discussion of the problem of catering to a high volume of transactions initiated from terminals by parametric users-the lowest level of user.  The use of Cobol as a basis for further development work is considered at some length with respect to data structures, host language capabilities, and self-contained capabilities.

In particular, the processor developed in this paper stresses the simultaneous operation (within the microinstruction) of the adder, shifter, masker, and testing facilities of the processor. A microassembly language is developed and the overhead involved in subroutine linkages is analyzed.

When an entry is to be filed in the hierarchy, a hashing algorithm will attempt to place the entry into one of these areas.

The history of pertinent activities would fill volumes, yet serious students of cryptography have always had nagging doubts about the cyphers' authenticity. It has been alleged that the \"known solution\" to Cypher Number Two: 115, 73, 24, 818, 37, 52, 49,...(\"I have deposited in the County of Bedford about four miles from Buford's in an excavation or vault...\") with the aid of an unsanitized version of the Declaration of Independence was merely a superb, imaginative, and grandiose hoax perpetrated ages ago for whatever reasons.  Modern computer technology could obviously perform signature analyses the process of encoding itself so as to yield new clues and deeper insights into their construction.  For the benefit of the uninitiated, the encoding method used in the second cypher employs a specified document whose words are simply numbered consecutively, and first letters of these words are sought out at random to match the letters of these words are sought out at random to match the letters of the clear text or message. The sequence of numbers corresponding to these matches is then written down as the final code.  While primitive, the process has the advantage of relative security until the source document becomes known; at that moment the cypher can be decoded even by second graders.  The work now completed with the help of our UNIVAC 1108 includes numerous analytical studies of the Beale cyphers and various types of simulations. For example, we have turned the entire process of simulated encoding by various schemes over to the machine and analyzed the signatures of these synthetic codes; we have also encoded various messages by hand, using different texts and a variety of methods to obtain their signatures. These simulations provide convincing evidence that the signatures are both process and data dependent; they indicate also very strongly that Mr. Beale's cyphers are for real and that it is merely a matter of time before someone finds the correct source document and locates the right vault in the common-wealth of Virginia."}

At the same time alterations in scheduling methods can be easily carried out in a controlled way with cause and effects relationships being isolated.  The scheduling methods tested included the best possible and worst possible methods, the traditional methods of multiprogramming theory, round-robin, first-come-first-served, etc., and dynamic predictors.  The relative and absolute performances of these scheduling methods are given.  It is concluded that a successful CPU scheduling method must be preemptive and must prevent a given job from holding the CPU for too long a period."}
{"_row":"2246\tBrown, P. J.;\tLevels of Language for Portable Software\t1972-12\tAn increasing amount of software is being implemented in a portable form.  A popular way of accomplishing this is to encode the software in a specially designed machine-independent language and then to map this language, often using a macro processor, into the assembly language of each desired object machine.  The design of the machine-independent language is the key factor in this operation. This paper discusses the relative merits of pitching this language at a high level or a low level, and presents some comparative results."}

The effectiveness of a \"modularization\" is dependent upon the criteria used in dividing the system into modules.  A system design problem is presented and both a conventional and unconventional decomposition are described.  It is shown that the unconventional decompositions have distinct advantages for the goals outlined.  The criteria used in arriving at the decompositions are discussed.  The unconventional decomposition, if implemented with the conventional assumption that a module consists of one or more subroutines, will be less efficient in most cases.  An alternative approach to implementation which does not have this effect is sketched."}

The method permits editing of the source language using a general purpose text editor, and incremental processing of changes without frequent recompilation of entire routines.  The essential points of the method are: (1) the syntax of the language is restricted insof ar as which constructs may occur on lines; (2) an internal data structure (called the skeleton) is maintained to represent the statement structure; (3) the recompilation is partially batched in the sense that recompilation of modified lines does not occur until the last of a set of editing commands has been received; and (4) the parsing and compilation are factored into two parts, that done on individual lines and that done globally to handle the relationships between the lines."}

Both take into account rule frequencies and the time needed to test conditions. One of the algorithms, called the optimum-finding algorithm, leads to a flowchart which truly minimizes execution time for a decision table in which simple rules are already contracted to complex rules.  The other one, called the optimum-approaching algorithm, requires many fewer calculations but does not necessarily produce the optimum flowchart.  The algorithms are first derived for treating decision tables not containing an ELSE-rule, but the optimum-approaching algorithm is shown to be equally valid for tables including such a rule.  Both algorithms are compared with existing ones and are applied to a somewhat large decision table derived from a real case.  From this comparison two conclusions are drawn.  (1) The optimum-approaching algorithm will usually lead to better results than comparable existing ones and will not require more, but usually less, computation time.(2) In general, the greater computation effort needed for applying the optimum-finding algorithm will not be justified by the small reduction in execution time obtained."}

{"_row":"2265\tLedgard, H. F.;\tA Model for Type Checking\t1972-11\tMost current programming languages treat computation over different classes of objects (e.g. numbers, strings, labels and functions).  For correct compilation and execution, the following question then arises: is a program properly constructed so that its operations and operands are compatible?  The activity of answering this question is usually called type checking.  This paper attempts to isolate the notion of type checking and presents a partial solution to the type checking problem based on the notions of abstraction and application of functions. In particular, a program is mapped into an expression within a decidable subset of the Lambda calculus, which characterizes the type relations within the program and eliminates all other information.  The determination of the type-wise correctness or incorrectness of the program is resolved by reducing its corresponding Lambda calculus expression to one of two normal forms, the constant \"correct\" for a type-wise correct program or the constant \"error\".  An application to type checking in Algol 60 is made, and the attendant problems faced for any notion of type checking are discussed."}

The chief computational advantage offered by cellular arrays is the improvement in speed achieved by virtue of the possibilities for parallel processing.  In this paper it is shown that cellular arrays are inherently well suited for the solution of many graph problems.  For example, the adjacency matrix of a graph is easily mapped onto an array; each matrix element is stored in one cell of the array, and typical row and column operations are readily implemented by simple cell logic.  A major challenge in the effective use of cellular arrays for the solution of graph problems is the determination of algorithms that exploit the possibilities for parallelism, especially for problems whose solutions appear to be inherently serial.  In particular, several parallelized algorithms are presented for the solution of certain spanning tree, distance, and path problems, with direct applications to wire routing, PERT chart analysis, and the analysis of many types of networks. These algorithms exhibit a computation time that in many cases grows at a rate not exceeding log2 n, where n is the number of nodes in the graph.  Straightforward cellular implementations of the well-known serial algorithms for these problems require about n steps, and noncellular implementations require from n^2 to n^3 steps."}

G.;\tRequirements for Advanced Programming Systems for List Processing\t1972-07\tList processing systems should be designed to facilitate production of large programs to manipulate large complex symbolic data stores.  This paper presents an overview of a number of system features which the author feels are important to improve the productivity of programmers working in such domains.  A system view it taken, rather than focusing just on language features, since algorithms must be not only coded in a language form, but debugged, modified, made efficient, and run on data.  Because of this general framework,the requirements specified are applicable to the design of advanced programming systems for a wide range of applications.  Three aspects of programming systems are highlighted: good interactive facilities, programmable control structures, and sophisticated data communication mechanisms.  Interactive features are described to facilitate program composition, entry, testing, debugging, editing, optimization, and packaging.  Implementation of a generalized environment structure model specified would allow programming of various control regimes including multiprocesses, coroutines and backtracking.  Alternative methods of procedure invocation required include invocation by pattern and by monitoring condition.  The  need for extended data forms, storage management, and extensibility are stressed, as is the duality of data retrieval and function evaluation.  Syntax directed input and output of data would facilitate use of complex data stores."}

In this paper a system of parallel processes is regarded as a machine which proceeds from one state S (i.e. a collection of pertinent data values and process configurations) to a next state S' in accordance with a transition rule S --> S'.  A set of such rules yields sequences of states, which dictate the system's behavior.  The mutual exclusion problem and the associated subproblems are formulated as questions of inclusion between sets of states, or of the existence of certain sequences.  A mechanical proof procedure is shown, which will either verify (prove the correctness of ) or discredit (prove the incorrectness of) an attempted solution, with respect to any of the interference properties.  It is shown how to calculate transition rules from the \"partial rules\" by which the individual processes operate. The formation of partial rules and the calculation of transition rules are both applicable to hardware processes as well as to software processes, and symmetry between processes is not required."}

System performance is based upon the mean cost of delay to all jobs processed. It is shown that significant improvements in the measure of system performance can be obtained by using variable time-slice techniques and by selecting the optimum round-robin cycle time.  It appears that these features would benefit from optimization whereas other parameters controllable by the scheduling algorithm affect system performance in a predictable manner and would not benefit from optimization.  Features not normally under the control of the scheduling algorithm can also have a marked effect on the measure of performance; in particular, supervisor overheads, the size of the store, and the speed of the CPU.

The high cost of these cosine transformations has been a serious drawback in using Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature. Two other problems related to the cosine transformation have also been trouble some.  First, the conventional computation of the cosine transformation by recurrence relation is numerically unstable, particularly at the low frequencies which have the largest effect upon the integral.  Second, in case the automatic scheme should require refinement of the sampling, storage is required to save the integrand values after the cosine transformation is computed.

Many contemporary systems permit some degree of sharing.  Usually, sharing is accomplished by allowing several users to share data via input and output of information stored in files kept in secondary storage. Through the use of segmentation, however, Multics provides direct hardware addressing by user and system programs of all information, independent of its physical storage location.  Information is stored in segments each of which is potentially sharable and carries its own independent attributes of size and access privilege.  Here, the design and implementation considerations of segmentation and sharing in Multics are first discussed under the assumption that all information resides in large, segmented main memory. Since the size of main memory on contemporary systems is rather limited, it is then shown how the Multics software achieves the effect of a large segmented main memory through the use of the Honeywell 645 segmentation and paging hardware."}

If certain conditions are satisfied, this is superior to the conventional ISAM method of chaining the overflow records via linked list techniques.  These conditions are: long overflow chains with significant overflow; lack of tight disk space constraints; record keys which are small compared to the total record size; and significant use of the file in the index as opposed to the sequential mode.  Using hashed overflow, the time to locate a record is dependent not on the total volume of overflow records as in conventional ISAM, but on the percentage use of space dedicated to overflow records."}

Thus, a call by a user procedure to a protected subsystem (including the supervisor) is identical to a call to a companion user procedure.  The mechanisms of passing and referencing arguments are the same in both cases as well."}

The supervisor handles I/O with external devices-the file and directory system-schedules active processes and manages memory, handle errors, and provides a small set of primitive functions which it will execute for a process.  A process is able to specify a request for a complicated action on the part of the supervisor (usually a wait on the occurrence of a compound event in the system) by combining these primitives into a \"supervisory computer program.\" The part of the supervisor which executes these programs may be viewed as a software implemented \"supervisory computer.\"  The paper develops these concepts in detail, outlines the remainder of the supervisor, and discusses some of the advantages of this approach."}

The \"relational triple\" notation used during interpretation of input is compatible with MUSE's memory structures, allowing direct verification of familiar concepts and the addition of new ones.

Pictorial pattern recognition techniques make possible a number of approaches to X-ray structure determination based on molecular model building, i.e. the use of chemical information to frame \"structural hypotheses\" which can computationally be tested and refined by reference to the experimental data.  Application of standard pattern recognition algorithms is hindered by the fact that the cross-correlation between a model and the correct structure cannot be computed because of a fundamental incompleteness in the measured data. However, it is possible to compute an upper bound to such a cross-correlation.  A simple example demonstrates that this information can be the basis of a technique for structure determination that can make effective use of an interactive graphics system. Model building by cross-correlations has intrinsic advantages over usual crystallographic techniques based on the autocorrelation or Patterson function, especially for large structures.  This is significant, for crystallography of biological macromolecules hasbeen and will continue to be a field of intense interest."}

{"_row":"2421\tJordan, B. W. Jr.;Barrett, R. C.;\tA Scan Conversion Algorithm with Reduced Storage Requirements\t1973-11\tMost graphics systems using a raster scan output device (CRT or hardcopy) maintain a display file in the XY or random scan format.  Scan converters, hardware or software, must be provided to translate the picture description from the XY format to the raster format.  Published scan conversion algorithms which are fast will reserve a buffer area large enough to accommodate the entire screen.  On the other hand, those which use a small buffer area are slow because they require multiple passes through the XY display file.  The scan conversion algorithm described here uses a linked list data structure to process the lines of the drawing in strips corresponding to groups of scan lines.  A relatively small primary memory buffer area is used to accumulate the binary image for a group of scan lines.  When this portion of the drawing has been plotted, the buffer is reused for the next portion.  Because of the list processing procedures used, only a single pass through the XY display file is required when generating the binary image and only a slight increase in execution time over the fully buffered core results.  Results slow that storage requirements can be reduced by more than 80 percent while causing less than a 10 percent increase in execution time."}

The technique of dynamic verification allows the construction of an operating system which does not make certain decisions improperly even in the presence of a single hardware or software fault.  Furthermore, multiple faults lead to unreliable operation only if the faults happen to reinforce each other.  On PRIME, dynamic verification is used to ensure that one user's information cannot become available to another user gratuitously even in the presence of a single hardware or software fault.the amount of additional hardware and software required for dynamic verification can be modest."}

It is shown that, by permitting imbalances of up to five units, the retrieval time is increased a small amount while the amount of restructuring required is decreased by a factor of ten.

It is shown how the system can be used to build composite data types out of simper ones with the operations of rowing, structuring, and uniting.  It is also demonstrated that completely new primitive types can be introduced into languages through the mechanism of singleton data types.  Both deterministic and nondeterministic functions are shown to be definable in the system. It is described how the local environment can be modeled as a data item and how imperative statements can be considered functions on the environment.  The nature of recursive functions is briefly discussed, and a technique is presented by which they can be introduced into the system.  The technique is contrasted with the use of the paradoxical combinator, Y.  The questions of local and global environments and of various modes of function calling and parameter passing are touched upon.

A general method for constructing such a tree or a graph is provided.  There are three important elements in this general construction method; namely, a set of binary relations, an algorithm for constructing subsets of a set, and an algorithm for selecting an element from the given set of objects.  The use of different relations and algorithms results in different information structures, as list, tree, ring, etc.  Thus the problem of information organization and storage is reduced to that of defining relations and formulating algorithms under a given set of constraints.

The read-interlock method does require a special\"read-interlock\" instruction in the repertoire of the processors and a special \"read-interlock\" cycle in the repertoire of the memory modules.  When a processor examines a \"lock\" (a memory location) with a read-interlock instruction, it will be interrupted if the lock was already set; examining a lock immediately sets it if it was not already set (this event sequence is a read-interlock cycle).

{"_row":"2499\tHamlet, R. G.;\tEfficient Multiprogramming Resource Allocation and Accounting\t1973-06\tAlthough sometimes thought of as only a component of time-sharing operation, multiprogramming can involve broader questions of resource allocation, since fairness is not required to meet a response criterion.  In a multiprogrammed system, it may serve maximal resource use to be unfair, for example by holding an input/output channel idle for a program while it completes a small amount of processor usage, enabling further use of the channel.  Several applications of this principle are given, and it is suggested that a multiprogramming executive might dynamically adjust its allocation algorithms to gain efficiency.  Allocation of resources is closely connected to accounting for those resources, raising the problems of repeatability, minimal uncharged overhead, and relative weighting of charges for dependent resources.  Since weightings may depend on allocation algorithms, these are not arbitrary accounting parameters.  Often the only repeatable accounting is one which omits an extensive overhead will be paid, and should multiprogramming prove efficient, overcharges will result.  Multiprogramming turns on allocation of the memory resource essential to control of other resources.  The general suggestions for allocation and accounting are applied to this question, and some details provided for the case of a monitor which controls a virtual-memory machine."}

The design objective was to provide a maximum degree of diagnostic assistance in a batch processing environment. For the most part this assistance is implicit and is provided automatically by the compiler. The most remarkable characteristic of PL/C is its perseverance-it completes translation of every program submitted and continues execution until a user-established error limit is reached. This requires that the compiler repair errors encountered during both translation and execution, and the design of PL/C is dominated by this consideration.  PL/C also introduces several explicit user-controlled facilities for program testing. To accommodate these extensions to PL/I without abandoning compatibility with IBM compiler PL/C permits \"pseudo comments\"-constructions whose contents can optionally be considered either source test or comment. In spite of the diagnostic effort PL/C is a fast and efficient processor.  It effectively demonstrates that compilers can provide better diagnostic assistance than is customarily offered, even when a sophisticated source language is employed, and that this assistance need not be prohibitively costly."}
{"_row":"2535\tPack, C.

It is concluded that while, for certain values of system parameters, there is noticeable improvement in the performance of the computer (model), in the sense that time-shared scheduling delays are reduced, these improvements are offset by the transmission delays imposed by multiplexing so that there may be little or no change in the computer-communications system performance.  Analytical and simulation results are based on the model of the computer-communications system being an M/D/1 queue (the multiplexor) in tandem with a single exponential server (the computer).

{"_row":"2598\tShwayder, K.;\tExtending the Information Theory Approach to Converting Limited-Entry Decision Tables to Computer Programs\t1974-09\tThis paper modifies an earlier algorithm for converting decision tables into flowcharts which minimize subsequent execution time when compiled into a computer program.  The algorithms considered in this paper perform limited search and, accordingly, do not necessarily result in globally optimal solutions.  However, the greater search effort needed to obtain a globally optimal solution for complex decision tables is usually not justified by sufficient savings in execution time.  There is an analogy between the problem of converting decision tables into efficient flowcharts and the well-understood problem in information theory of noiseless coding.  The results of the noiseless coding literature are used to explore the limitations of algorithms used to solve the decision table problem.  The analogy between the two problems is also used to develop improvements to the information algorithm in extending the depth of search under certain conditions and in proposing additional conditions to be added to the decision table.  Finally, the information algorithm is compared with an algorithm proposed in a recent paper by Verhelst."}

Five experiments were conducted to measure the cpu time on a CDC 6400 required by additive ciphers programmed both in assembly language and in Fortran: a \"null transformation\" to measure the time to move data without encipherment; encipherment with one-word key; encipherment with a 125-word key; double key encipherment; and encipherment using a pseudo random key.  The results were analyzed for consistency over 100 runs, and the effects of constant and intermittent errors were considered. Timing rates for assembly language encipherment ranged from 498,800 characters per second for a pseudo random key cipher to 2,092,000 characters per second for a constant one-word key cipher.  The latter is almost equivalent to the rate required simply to move data without encipherment.  Fortran tests required over four times as much cpu time.

The system compares this password with one recorded in a Password Table which is available to only the authentication program.  The integrity of the system depends on keeping the table secret.  In this paper a password scheme is presented which does not require secrecy in the computer.    All aspects of the system, including all relevant code and data bases, may be known by anyone attempting to intrude.  The scheme is based on using a function H which the would-be intruder is unable to invert.  This function is applied to the user's password and the result compared to a table entry, a match being interpreted as authentication of the user.  The intruder may know all about H and have access to the table, but he can penetrate the system only if he can invert H to determine an input that produces a given output.  This paper discusses issues surrounding selection of a suitable H.  Two different plausible arguments are given that penetration would be exceedingly difficult, and it is then argued that more rigorous results are unlikely.  Finally, some human engineering problems relating to the scheme are discussed."}

The direct use of a capability as an address is shown to overcome these difficulties because it provides the needed absolute address. Implementation of capability-based addressing is discussed. It is predicted that the use of tags to identify capabilities will dominate.  A hardware address translation scheme which never requires the modification of the representation of capabilities is suggested. The scheme uses a main memory hash table for obtaining a segment's location in main memory given its unique code.  The hash table is avoided for recently accessed segments by means of a set of associative registers.

The results of the simulation studies presented show that neither scheduling discipline is unconditionally superior to the other.  For most fixed-head drum applications, the SLTF discipline is preferable to MTPT, but for intra-cylinder disk scheduling the MTPT discipline offers a distinct advantage over the SLTF discipline.  The computational requirements of an algorithm that implements the MTPT scheduling discipline are shown to be comparable to SLTF algorithms.

This method treats text as a string of characters rather than words bounded by spaces, and chooses subsets of strings such that their frequencies of occurrence are more even than those of word types.  The members of this subset are then used as index keys for retrieval. The rectangular distribution of key frequencies results in a much simplified file organization and promises considerable cost advantages."}

The algorithm is general in the sense that the page fault probabilities can be calculated for nonpredictive replacement rules applied to any program represented by a one-step Markov chain.  A detailed example is given to illustrate the algorithm for Random and Least Recently Used (LRU) replacement rules."}
{"_row":"2669\tSaltzer, J. H.;\tA Simple Linear Model of Demand Paging Performance\t1974-04\tPredicting the performance of a proposed automatically managed multilevel memory system requires a model of the patterns by which programs refer to the information stored in the memory.  Some recent experimental measurements on the Multics virtual memory suggest that, for rough approximations, a remarkably simple program reference model will suffice.  The simple model combines the effect of the information reference pattern with the effect of the automatic management algorithm to produce a single, composite statement: the mean number of memory references between paging exceptions increases linearly with the size of the paging memory.  The resulting model is easy to manipulate, and is applicable to such diverse problems as choosing an optimum size for a paging memory, arranging for reproducible memory usage charges, and estimating the amount of core memory sharing."}

These algorithms are able to clip polygons against irregular convex plane-faced volumes in three dimensions, removing the parts of the polygon which lie outside the volume.  In two dimensions the algorithms permit clipping against irregular convex windows. Polygons to be clipped are represented as an ordered sequence of vertices without repetition of first and last, in marked contrast to representation as a collection of edges as was heretofore the common procedure.  Output polygons have an identical format, with new vertices introduced in sequence to describe any newly-cut edge or edges.  The algorithms easily handle the particularly difficult problem of detecting that a new vertex may be required at a corner of the clipping window.  The algorithms described achieve considerable simplicity by clipping separately against each clipping plane or window boundary.  Code capable of clipping the polygon against a single boundary is reentered to clip against subsequent boundaries. Each such reentrant stage of clipping need store only two vertex values and may begin its processing as soon as the first output vertex from the proceeding stage is ready.  Because the same code is reentered for clipping against subsequent boundaries, clipping against very complex window shapes is practical. For perspective applications in three dimentions, a six-plane truncated pyramid is chosen as the clipping volume.  The two additional planes parallel to the projection screen serve to limit the range of depth preserved through the projection.  A perspective projection method which provides for arbitrary view angles and depth of field in spite of simple fixed clipping planes is described.  This method is ideal for subsequent hidden-surface computations."}

It is also proved that the computed LU decomposition converges when floating-point arithmetic is used and that the limits of the LU diagonals using floating point are roughly within machine precision of the limits using real arithmetic.  This fact is exploited to reduce the number of floating-point operations required to solve a linear system from 8n-7 to 5n+2k-3, where k is much less than n, the order of the matrix.  If the elements of the subdiagonals and superdiagonals are 1, then only 4n+2k-3 operations are needed.

On the other hand, if both k and the subject grammar are problem parameters, then the complexity of the problem depends very strongly on the representation chosen for k.

The simple case of two processors, one performing LISP-like list operations and the other performing garbage collection continuously, is thoroughly examined. The necessary capabilities of each processor are defined, as well as interprocessor communication and interlocks. Complete procedures for garbage collection and for standard list processing primitives are presented and thoroughly explained.  Particular attention is given to the problems of marking and relocating list cells while another processor may be operating on them.  The primary aim throughout is to allow the list processor to run unimpeded while the other processor reclaims list storage.  The more complex cases involving several list processors and one or more garbage collection processors are also briefly discussed."}

If some of the decision rules implied in the ELSE Rule occur with low frequency, then the ELSE Rule can be used to further simplify the decision table.  Several objectives merit consideration in optimizing a decision table:(1) reducing machine execution time; (2) reducing preprocessing time; (3) reducing required machine memory; (4) reducing the number of decision rules. (This often improves the clarity of the decision table to a human reader.)  It will be shown that objectives (3) and (4) can be furthered with the above methods.

E.;\tOn the External Storage Fragmentation Produced by First-Fit and Best-Fit Allocation Strategies\t1975-08\tPublished comparisons of the external fragmentation produced by first-fit and best-fit memory allocation have not been consistent.  Through simulation, a series of experiments were performed in order to obtain better data on the relative performance of first-fit and best-fit and a better understanding of the reasons underlying observed differences. The time-memory-product efficiencies of first-fit and best-fit were generally within 1 to 3 percent of each other.  Except for small populations, the size of the request population had little effect on allocation efficiency.  For exponential and hyperexponential distributions of requests, first-fit outperformed best-fit; but for normal and uniform distributions, and for exponential distributions distorted in various ways, best-fit outperformed first-fit.  It is hypothesized that when first-fit outperforms best-fit, it does so because first-fit, by preferentially allocating toward one end of memory, encourages large blocks to grow at the other end.  Sufficient contiguous space is thereby more likely to be available for relatively large requests.  Results of simulation experiments supported this hypothesis and showed that the relative performance of first-fit and best-fit depends on the frequency of request.  When the coefficient of variation of the request distribution is greater than or approximately equal to unity, first-fit outperformed best-fit."}

While it would be desirable to obtain an optimal solution to this allocation problem, it is clear that the number of parameters involved makes it intractable to straight-forward solution. In such a situation, we must find a set of assumptions which simplify the problem greatly, but which still provide a basis for considering all significant cost elements. This paper presents such a first, quantitative allocation step.  It considers many of the significant detailed costs of system utilization, data storage, data staging, and data migration.  Although many avenues of further improvement are available, the present algorithm seems to be usefully accurate. As such, it can aid in quantifying the problems of data set allocation, storage system configuration, and new device designs."}

This task was chosen because it is simple, well defined, and characteristic of many design tasks in architecture, engineering, urban planning, and natural resource management.  These space planning tasks usually involve manipulating two-dimensional representations of objects to create feasible or optimal solutions for problems involving topological and metric spatial constraints.  The paper describes extensive tests performed on the program.  DPS is a heuristic problem solver with a planning phase prefixed to it.  It uses the planning process to give it a sense of direction, diagnostic procedures to locate difficulties, and remedial actions to recover from difficulties.  It uses a convex polygon representation to accurately describe the objects and the layout.  This representation allows topological and metric constraints to be tested and the design to be easily updated.  DPS has been applied to 50 problems. While it is slow and limited in scope, the ideas behind it are general.

By using an extension of traditional structure information, or a geometric hierarchy, five significant improvements to current techniques are possible.  First, the range of complexity of an environment is greatly increased while the visible complexity of any given scene is kept within a fixed upper limit.  Second, a meaningful way is provided to vary the amount of detail presented in a scene.  Third, \"clipping\" becomes a very fast logarithmic search for the resolvable parts of the environment within the field of view.  Fourth, frame to frame coherence and clipping define a graphical \"working set,\" or fraction of the total structure that should be present in primary store for immediate access by the visible surface algorithm.

{"_row":"2851\tKeller, R. M.;\tFormal Verification of Parallel Programs\t1976-07\tTwo formal models for parallel computation are presented: an abstract conceptual model and a parallel-program model.  The former model does not distinguish between control and data states.  The latter model includes the capability for the representation of an infinite set of control states by allowing there to be arbitrarily many instruction pointers (or processes) executing the program.  An induction principle is presented which treats the control and data state sets on the same ground.  Through the use of \"place variables,\" it is observed that certain correctness conditions can be expressed without enumeration of the set of all possible control states. Examples are presented in which the induction principle is used to demonstrate proofs of mutual exclusion. It is shown that assertions-oriented proof methods are special cases of the induction principle. A special case of the assertions method, which is called parallel place assertions, is shown to be incomplete.  A formalization of \"deadlock\" is then presented. The concept of a \"norm\" is introduced, which yields an extension, to the deadlock problem, of Floyd's technique for proving termination.  Also discussed is an extension of the program model which allows each process to have its own local variables and permits shared global variables.  Correctness of certain forms of implementation is also discussed. An Appendix is included which relates this work to previous work on the satisfiability of certain logical formulas."}

The practical importance of intentional resolution is demonstrated by several examples, and its realization is discussed.  It is shown that intentional resolution can be achieved, but that it involves a radical change from the traditional approach to the process of user-database interaction.

This paper provides evidence that this strategy can indeed result in good object code.  The traditionally difficult PL/I concatenate statement was investigated as a detailed example.  A set of fairly simple optimizations was identified which allow the compiler to produce good code. More elaborate optimizations can further improve the object code.

The strings may be variable length, without a maximum length restriction, and no symbols need be reserved for control purposes.  Hence any symbol may occur in any string.  The scheme is useful for multifield sorting, multifield indexing, and other applications where ordering on more than one field is important."}

The first method, the \"quotient reduction\" method, is shown to be complete in the sense that for every set I the smallest table in which the elements of I can be stored and from which they can be retrieved by using a perfect hashing function constructed by this method can be found.  However, for nonuniformly distributed sets, this method can give rather sparse tables. The second method, the \"remainder reduction\" method, is not complete in the above sense, but it seems to give minimal (or almost minimal) tables for every kind of set.

A new derivation is given, and it is shown that previous derivations make an assumption that may be violated frequently.  On the basis of the simulation data and the derivation, it is hypothesized that the anomalous behavior results from the combined effects of systematic placement and the statistics of the release process.  Additional simulations support this hypothesis.  Systematic placement, which refers to the natural convention of always allocating storage requests against the same end of the free block selected by the allocation strategy, tends to order blocks within contiguous groups according to their allocation time.  The degree of anomalous behavior depends on the extent to which allocated blocks are released in the order of their allocation.  For non-Markovian release processes, the extent of the correlation between allocation order and release order varies approximately inversely with the coefficient of variation of the memory residence time distribution. The simulations show that allocation efficiency depends strongly on the residence time distribution; efficiency decreases as the distribution's coefficient of variation increases.  Some practical implications are briefly discussed."}

{"_row":"2916\tBoyer, R.

The information gained by starting the match at the end of the pattern often allows the algorithm to proceed in large jumps through the text being searched.  Thus the algorithm has the unusual property that, in most cases, not all of the first i characters of string are inspected.  The number of characters actually inspected (on the average) decreases as a function of the length of pat.  For a random English pattern of length 5, the algorithm will typically inspect i/4 characters of string before finding a match at i.  Furthermore, the algorithm has been implemented so that (on the average) fewer than i+patlen machine instructions are executed.  These conclusions are supported with empirical evidence and a theoretical analysis of the average behavior of the algorithm. The worst case behavior of the algorithm is linear in i+patlen, assuming the availability of array space for tables linear in patlen plus the size of the alphabet."}

The proposed attitude aims at retaining the purity of the nondeterministic formulation of search processes on one level (the attempt level), deferring the coordination of problem solving efforts to another (the choice level).  The feasibility of recognizing these two levels is discussed, stressing that the structure to be managed at the choice level is a free of contexts. The leaves are computational environments, each holding an alternative under inspection, while the other nodes are associated with choice poin ts. According to the proposed programming style, a generative function is associated with each choice poin t, which expresses the desired choice strategy. The main advantage on this approach is the localization of the search strategies: Each nonterminal node of the tree keeps track of the state of the computation as it was when the choice poin t was last interrogated, holding at the same time the strategy to coordinate the available alternatives.  Examples are given in term of ND-Lisp, an extension of Lisp designed and implemented according to these guidelines."}

{"_row":"2931\tScott, D. S.;\tLogic and Programming Languages\t1977-09\tLogic has been long in terested in whether answers to certain questions are computable in principle, since the outcome puts bounds on the possibilities of formalization.  More recently, precise comparisons in the efficiency of decision methods have become available through the developments in complexity theory. These, however, are applications to logic, and a big question is whether methods of logic have significance in the other direction for the more applied parts of computability theory.  Programming languages offer an obvious opportunity as their syntactic formalization is well advanced; however, the semantical theory can hardly be said to be complete.  Though we have many examples, we have still to give wide-ranging mathematical answers to these queries:  What is a machine? What is a computable process?  How (or how well) does a machine simulate a process?  Programs naturally enter in giving descriptions of processes. The definition of the precise meaning of a program then requires us to explain what are the objects of computation (in a way, the statics of the problem) and how they are to be transformed (the dynamics). So far the theories of automata and of nets, though most in teresting for dynamics, have formalized only a portion of the field, and there has been perhaps too much concentration on the finite-state and algebraic aspects.  It would seem that the understanding of higher-level program features involves us with infinite objects and forces us to pass through several levels of explanation to go from the conceptual ideas to the final simulation on a real machine.  These levels can be made mathematically exact if we can find the right abstractions to represent the necessary structures. The experience of many independent workers with the method of data types as lattices (or partial orderings) under an information content ordering, and with their continuous mappings, has demonstrated the flexibility of this approach in providing definitions and proofs, which are clean and without undue dependence on implementations.  Nevertheless much remains to be done in showing how abstract conceptualizations can (or cannot) be actualized before we can say we have a unified theory."}

Various classes of scheduling algorithms are defined and related to existing algorithms.  A criterion for the implementation efficiency of an algorithm is developed and results in the definition of time-invariant algorithms, which include most of the commonly implemented ones.  For time-invariant algorithms, the dependence of processing rates on priorities is derived.  The abstract model provides a framework for implementing flexible schedulers in real operating systems.  The policy-driven scheduler of Bernstein and Sharp is discussed as an example of such an implementation"}

This research is a first step toward assisting the user in participating in the vast store of resources available on a network. Analytical, simulation, and statistical performance evaluation tools are employed to investigate the feasibility of a dynamic response time monitor that is capable of providing comparative response time information for users wishing to process various computing applications at some network computing node.  The research clearly reveals that sufficient system data are currently obtainable, at least for the five diverse ARPA network systems studied in detail, to describe and predict the response time for network time-sharing systems as it depends on some measure of system activity or load level."}

Since assignment, CALL, RETURN, and IF statements together account for 93 percent of all executable statements, special care is given to ensure that these statements can be implemented efficiently.  A highly compact instruction encoding scheme is presented, which can reduce program size by a factor of 3.  Unlike a Huffman code, which utilizes variable length fields, this method uses only fixed length (1-byte) op code and address fields.  The most frequent instructions consist of a single 1-byte field.  As a consequence, instruction decoding time is minimized, and the machine is efficient with respect to both space and time."}

In storing these structures, preserving logical adjacencies or \"proximity\" is usually an important consideration. The combinatorial problem of storing arrays as various kinds of list structures is examined.  Embeddings of graphs are used to model the loss of proximity involved in such storage schemes, and an elementary proof that arrays cannot be stored as linear lists with bounded loss of proximity is presented.  Average loss of proximity is then considered, and it is shown that arrays cannot be stored as linear lists with only bounded loss of average proximity, but can be so stored in binary trees.  The former result implies, for instance, that row major order is an asymptotically optimal storage strategy for arrays."}

This approach, the intermittent-assertion method, involves documenting the program with assertions that must be true at some time when control passes through the corresponding point, but that need not be true every time.  The method, introduced by Burstall, promises to provide a valuable complement to the more conventional methods.  The intermittent-assertion method is presented with a number of examples of correctness and termination proofs.  Some of these proofs are markedly simpler than their conventional counterparts. On the other hand, it is shown that a proof of correctness or termination by any of the conventional techniques can be rephrased directly as a proof using intermittent assertions.  Finally, it is shown how the intermittent-assertion method can be applied to prove the validity of program transformations and the correctness of continuously operating programs."}

An important version of the problem in medicine is that of obtaining the exact density distribution within the human body from X-ray projections.One approach that has been taken to solve this problem consists of translating the available information into a system of linear inequalities.  The size and the sparsity of the resulting system (typically, 25,000 inequalities with fewer than 1 percent of the coefficients nonzero) makes methods using successive relaxations computationally attractive, as compared to other ways of solving systems of inequalities. In this paper, it is shown that, for a consistent system of linear inequalities, any sequence of relaxarion parameters lying strictly between 0 and 2 generates a sequence of vectors which converges to a solution. Under the same assumptions, for a system of linear equations, the relaxation method converges to the minimum norm solution.  Previously proposed techniques are shown to be special cases of our procedure with different choices of relaxation parameters.  The practical consequences for image reconstruction of the choice of the relaxation parameters are discussed."}

This has two important consequences: (1) Couriers or other secure means are not needed to transmit keys, since a message can be enciphered using an encryption key publicly revealed by the intended recipient. Only he can decipher the message, since only he knows the corresponding decryption key.  (2) A message can be \"signed\" using a privately held decryption key.  Anyone can verify this signature using the corresponding publicly revealed encryption key.  Signatures cannot be forged, and a signer cannot later deny the validity of his signature.  This has obvious applications in \"electronic mail\" and \"electronic funds transfer\" systems.  A message is encrypted by representing it as a number M, raising M to a publicly specified power e, and then taking the remainder when the result is divided by the publicly specified product, n, of two large secret prime numbers p and q.

{"_row":"3052\tEaston, M.C.;Fagin, R.;\tCold-Start vs. Warm-Start Miss Ratios\t1978-10\tIn a two-level computer storage hierarchy, miss ratio measurements are often made from a \"cold start,\" that is made with the first-level  store initially empty.  For large capacities the effect on the measured miss ratio of the misses incurred while filling the first-level store can be significant, even for long reference strings.  Use of \"warm-start\" rather than \"cold-start\" miss ratios cast doubt on the widespread belief that the observed \"S-shape\" of lifetime (reciprocal of miss ratio) versus capacity curve indicates a property of behavior of programs that maintain a constant number of pages in main storage. On the other hand, if cold-start miss ratios are measured as a function of capacity and measurement length, then they are useful in studying systems in which operation of a program is periodically interrupted by task switches.  It is shown how to obtain, under simple assumptions, the cache miss ratio for multiprogramming from cold-start miss ratio values and how to obtain approximate cold-start miss ratios from warm-start miss ratios."}

These systems promise both financial benefits for the institutions that use them and potential conveniences to their customers.  However, they also raise significant social, legal, and technical questions that must be resolved if full scale systems for Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) are not to cause more problems for the larger public than they solve.

These conflicts reflect the relative importance of certain problems for specific groups.  The value positions implicit in EFT proposals help to organize analyses of market arrangements, system reliability, and privacy of transactions.  These topics are analyzed in this article and related to the value positions held by concerned parties.  Last, the ways in which the public can learn about the social qualities of different EFT arrangements and the pace of EFT developments are both discussed in the context of social choice."}
{"_row":"3077\tBackus, J.;\tCan Programming Be Liberated from the von Neumann Style?  A Functional Style and Its Algebra of Programs\t1978-08\tConventional programming languages are growing ever more enormous, but not stronger.  Inherent defects at the most basic level cause them to be both fat and weak: their primitive word-at-a-time style of programming inherited from their common ancestor-the von Neumann computer, their close coupling off semantics to state transitions, their division of programming into a world of expressions and a world of statements, their inability to effectively use powerful combining forms for building new programs from existing ones, and their lack of useful mathematical properties for reasoning about programs. An alternative functional style of programming is founded on the use of combining forms for creating programs. Functional programs deal with structured data, are often nonrepetitive and nonrecursive, are hierarchically constructed, do not name their arguments, and do not require the complex machinery of procedure declarations to become generally applicable.  Combining forms can use high level programs to build still higher level ones in a style not possible in conventional languages. Associated with the functional style of programming is an algebra of programs whose variables range over programs and whose operations are combining forms. This algebra can be used to transform programs and to solve equations whose \"unknowns\" are programs in much the same way one transforms equations in high school algebra.  These transformations are given by algebraic laws and are carried out in the same language in which programs are written.  Combining forms are chosen not only for their programming power but also for the power of their associated algebraic laws.  General theorems of of the algebra give the detailed behavior and termination conditions for large classes of programs.  A new class of computing systems uses the functional programming style both in its programming language and in its state transition rules.  Unlike von Neumann languages, these systems have semantics loosely coupled to states-only one state transition occurs per major computation."}

Since rerooting leaves assoc [v, a] invariant, for all variables v and all environments a, the programmer can have access to a rerooting primitive, shallow[], which gives him dynamic control over whether accesses are shallow or deep, and which affects only the speed of execution of a program, not its semantics.  In addition, multiple processes can be active in the same environment structure, so long as rerooting is an indivisible operation.

{"_row":"3097\tSites, R.L.;\tOptimal Shift Strategy for a Block-Transfer CCD Memory\t1978-05\tFor the purposes of this paper, a block-transfer CCD memory is composed of serial shift registers whose shift rate can vary, but which have a definite minimum shift rate (the refresh rate) and a definite maximum shift rate.  The bits iin the shift registers are numbered 0 to N - 1, and blocks of N bits are always transferred, always starting at bit 0.   What is the best shift strategy so that a block transfer request occurring at a random time will have to wait the minimal amount of time before bit 0 can be reached? The minimum shift rate requirement does not allow one to  simply \"park\" at bit 0 and wait for a transfer request.  The optimal strategy involves shifting as slowly as possible until bit 0 is passed, then shifting as quickly as possible until a critical boundary is reached, shortly before bit 0 comes around again. This is called the \"hurry up and wait\" strategy and is well known outside the computer field.  The block-transfer CCD memory can also be viewed as a paging drum with a variable (bounded) rotation speed."}

In the past, programming systems have provided only a single general purpose implementation for an abstract type. Thus the programs produced using abstract types were then inefficient in space or time.  In this paper a system for automatically choosing efficient implementations for abstract types from a library of implementations is discussed.

Classical implementations of list processing systems lack this property because allocating a list cell from the heap may cause a garbage collection, which process requires time proportional to the heap size to finish.  A real-time list processing system is presented which continuously reclaims garbage, including directed cycles, while linearizing and compacting the accessible cells into contiguous locations to avoid fragmenting the free storage pool.  The program is small and requires no time-sharing interrupts, making it suitable for microcode.  Finally, the system requires the same average time, and not more than twice the space, of a classical implementation, and those space requirements can be reduced to approximately classical proportions by compact list representation.

The model views file and program design as a problem of systematically coordinating the configurations of datasets and computations.  It uses a straight forward search technique to determine aggregations of computations, aggregations of datasets, device, organization, and key order for each data set, key order for each computation, and access method  for each dataset-computation pair.  Although computational results are presented for a sample problem involving 54 computations and 49 datasets, the main point of the paper is that the underlying model works computationally an d is simple enough to be adapted to many file design situations."}

Current programming language concepts will not be adequate for building and maintaining systems of the complexity called for by the tasks we attempt.  Just as high level languages enabled the programmer to escape from the intricacies of a machine's order code, higher level programming systems can provide the means to understand and manipulate complex systems and components.  In order to develop such systems, we need to shift our attention away from the detailed specification of algorithms, towards the description of the properties of the packages and objects with which we build.  This paper analyzes some of the shortcomings of programming languages as they now exist, and lays out some possible directions for future research."}

An efficient method for accomplishing this reorganization is given.  This also makes possible the derivation of an asymptotically better bound for multiplication of matrices given in row-oriented form by adapting the technique of Strassen to the reorganized data.  The reorganization/block multiplication scheme is shown to be advantageous for matrices and pages of realistic size; the Strassen adaptation is not.  The former scheme is also shown to be advantageous even if the transpose of one of the matrices is available at no additional cost."}

Two parameterized algorithms which partition the main memory between two classes of jobs are considered.  Initially, a closed system consisting of a process or and paging and file devices, with fixed numbers of jobs, is studied to determine optimal degrees of multiprogramming and the proportion of processor time devoted to each class.  Applying a decomposition approach and treating the closed system as a single server, the response times in an open system with external arrivals are studied.  The object is to investigate the effect of the memory alocation parameters on the expected response times under the two algorithms. Numerical solutions and economical lower bounds for the expected response times as functions of the control parameters are obtained.  A way of applying the results to systems with more than two job classes is indicated."}

{"_row":"3157\tDershowitz, N.;Manna, Z.;\tProving Termination with Multiset Orderings\t1979-08\tA common tool for proving the termination of programs is the well-founded set, a set ordered in such a way as to admit no infinite descending sequences. The basic approach is to find a termination function  that maps the values of the program variables into some well-founded set, such that the value of the termination function is repeatedly reduced throughout the computation.  All too often, the termination functions required are difficult to find and are of a complexity out of proportion to the program under consideration. Multisets (bags) over a given well-founded set S are sets that admit multiple occurrences of elements taken from S.  The given ordering on S induces an ordering on the finite multisets over S.  This multiset ordering is shown to be well-founded.  The multiset ordering enables the use of relatively simple and intuitive termination functions in otherwise difficult termination proofs.  In particular, the multiset ordering is used to prove the termination of production systems, programs defined in terms of sets of rewriting rules."}

The algorithm operates in time O(log n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree.  This represents an improvement over the best previous ly known insertion algorithms of Hirschberg and Kosaraju, which require time O(log 2n).  Moreover, the O(log n) complexity is optimal. Earlier results have shown that deletion in such a structure can also be performed in O(log n) time.  Thus the result of this paper gives a negative answer to the question of whether such trees should be the first examples of their kind, where deletion has a smaller time complexity than insertion.  Furthermore, it can now be concluded that insertion, deletion, and retrieval in OSHB trees can be performed in the same time as the corresponding operations for the more general AVL trees, to within a constant factor.  However, the insertion and deletion algorithms for OSHB trees appear much more complicated than the corresponding algorithms for AVL trees."}
